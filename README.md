# project3WrangleOpenStreetMapData

This project wrangles and clean OpenStreetMap data of a Central New york region using data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.

The cleaned OpenStreetMap data is then converted to a JSON document and then imported into MongoDB database. The database was then analyzed using MongoDB queries and a report of the analysis was generated.

To read the report of the process, please read "Report.pdf".

The other files are Python code to clean the osm file and convert to JSON format. Each files description is provided in the report file.
